# Music_Store_Anaysis_SQL
Introduction:

The Music Store Data Analysis project involves exploring and querying a relational music database using SQL to derive meaningful insights from the business operations of a digital music store. The database contains tables related to employees, customers, invoices, tracks, artists, albums, playlists, and more. This project enhances SQL proficiency and highlights how structured data analysis can support strategic business decisions in the music retail industry.

The analysis is conducted in three levels — Easy, Moderate, and Advanced — each with queries addressing real-world business questions, such as identifying top customers, popular music genres, revenue-generating cities, and artist performance.


Objective:

To uncover business insights that can help improve sales, marketing, and customer experience.

To segment and understand customer behavior through invoice and genre data.

To identify key contributors (artists, cities, countries) to the company’s revenue.

To prepare data-driven strategies like targeting high-value customers or cities for events.
